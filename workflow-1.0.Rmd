## Pre-collection training

### Overview (1.5 hrs)

#### Discussion

- How is the play-project.org website used to support training?

### Training 2

### Training 3

### Training 4

## Data collection

See steps described in <https://www.play-project.org/collection.html>

### Post-visit data upload

1. *Data Collection Site RA* creates a session within the site-specific volume and completes Databrary spreadsheet data.
1. *Data Collection Site RA* uploads video to the site-specific Databrary volume.
1. *Data Collection Site RA* uploads ambient sound recording to data session on site-specific Databrary volume.
1. *KoboToolbox application* uploads data file to Kobotoolbox server.

#### Discussion

- *Launch Group PIs* will 'co-own' data with PLAY PIs, so uploading to site-specific Databrary volumes makes sense for initial upload.
This also ensures that session-specific metadata is entered in a consistent fashion and makes it possible to create automated workflows down the line.
- *How does KoBoToolbox questionnaire data get from KoBoToolbox server to the proper volume and session?*

## Quality Assurance (QA)

### Data retrieval

#### Survey data from KoboToolbox server

1. *PLAY staff* download KoBoToolbox file from KoBoToolbox server to <WORKING DIRECTORY UNSPECIFIED>.

#### Session metadata from Databrary

1. *PLAY staff* rrtrieve session metadata from Databrary volume

#### Video and audio files from Databrary

### Data evaluation

#### KoBoToolbox-derived data

1. *PLAY staff* generate NDAR GUID using NYU server.
1. *PLAY staff* add NDAR GUID to appropriate Databrary session and volume.

#### Comparing KoBoToolbox data with Databrary session

1. *PLAY staff* compare participant demographic data from KoBoToolbox to that entered into the Databrary spreadsheet.
1. *PLAY staff* reconcile discrepancies.

#### Video

#### Audio file

### Discussion

- There is an API for KoboToolbox.
  - *Could we script the transfer of KoboToolbox files to Box?*
- *PLAY staff* must retrieve video and audio files from site-specific volumes and sessions. 
  - *How do PLAY staff know when there are files for them to process?*
  - *Can Databrary's notifications feature provide information about uploaded files that are ready for QA?*
- *PLAY staff* must download video files from site-specific volumes to i) play videos and ii) generate QA Datavyu file.
  - *What is the QA coding protocol?*
  - *What is an example QA Datavyu file?*
  - *Could we use Box as working file server for QA and coding assignments?*
    - Box would be more flexible than creating new Databrary volumes.
    - Box has an API that we might be able to access via scripts.
    - There is an R package for the Box API: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boxr/vignettes/boxr.html>
- *Do audio files undergo QA?*
- *How does questionnaire data undergo QA?*

## Coding

### Pre-coding training

1. *PLAY staff* ship coding equipment to coding labs.
1. *PLAY staff* conduct training.

### Assigning videos to coding labs

1. *PLAY staff* assign videos to coding labs based on source of video and the coding pass a lab is trained to provide.
1. *PLAY staff* generate a *Template Datavyu Coding File* associated with the assigned coding pass.

#### Discussion

- *Template Datavyu Coding File* must contain the code and code definitions.
- *Template Datavyu Coding File* must have an initial ID column with metadata about the participant and the video file name to which it is linked.
- *Template Datavyu Coding File* must have a file name that matches the video.

### Coding labs acquire videos

1. *Coding Site RA* downloads assigned video for coding.

### Coding

Coding protocols for each pass are described in <https://www.play-project.org/coding.html>

### Coding files get returned

1. *Coding Site RA* copies completed *Template Datavyu Coding File* to <FILE DIRECTORY NOT YET ASSIGNED>.
